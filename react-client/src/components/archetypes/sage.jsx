            To a sage, wisdom is the key to success.
            Everything else is secondary to the pursuit of knowledge.
            Though this brand might give you the warm and fuzzies,
            and they donâ€™t enrapture you in a fantasy world like Disney,
            a sage commands respect by illustrating brilliance.

            Harvard University is a sage.
            The academic environment is one of the most revered in the world,
            boasting an alumni list that includes eight U.S. presidents, 21 Nobel laureates and Mark Zuckerberg (sort of).</h1>
