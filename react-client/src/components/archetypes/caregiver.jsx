          Those who identify with the caregiver archetypes are full of empathy and compassion. Unfortunately, others can exploit their good nature for their own ends. Caregivers must pay attention to looking after themselves and learning to say no to othersâ€™ demands sometimes.

          <li>Goal: to help others</li>
          <li>Fear: being considered selfish</li>
          <li>Weakness: being exploited by others and feeling put upon</li>
          <li>Talent: compassion and generosity</li>

        </h1>
