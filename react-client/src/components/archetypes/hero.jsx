              The hero thrives on being strong and standing up for others. They may feel they have a destiny that they must accomplish. Heroes are courageous in their quest for justice and equality and will stand up to even the most powerful forces if they think they are wrong.

              Goal: to help others and protect the weak
              Fear: being perceived as weak or frightened
              Weakness: arrogance, always needing another battle to fight
              Talent: competence and courage
