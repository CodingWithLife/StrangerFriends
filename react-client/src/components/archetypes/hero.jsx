            The hero makes the world better by being the best.
            A hero brand isn’t concerned with nurturing, it’s there to challenge you.
            If you want to rise to the occasion, you’re going to need a hero’s help.

            The U.S. Army is the ultimate example of a hero archetype.
            Think of the recruitment commercials you’ve seen with troops jumping out of helicopters,
            running through training courses and protecting the country. Does any of that resemble your day-to-day?
            Of course not. It’s not supposed to. It’s designed to compel you to “answer the call.”</h1>
