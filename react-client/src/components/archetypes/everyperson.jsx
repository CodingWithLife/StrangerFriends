          Morality, virtue, and equality are important–and when you are an Everyperson, perhaps they are appreciated more than anything else.
          Among the twelve archetypes, there are none more “centered” than he.
          The Everyperson is not just centered in heart and spirituality and education, but also in the “wheel” of archetypes.
          The Everyperson can easily turn into any of the other Soul or Self types.</h1>
