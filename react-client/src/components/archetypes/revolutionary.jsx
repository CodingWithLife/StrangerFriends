          Rebels like to do things differently.
          However, sometimes rebels can abandon perfectly good traditions just because they have a desire for reform.
          Rebels can be charismatic and easily encourage others to follow them in their pursuit of rebellion.

          <ul>Goal: to overturn what isn’t working</ul>
          <ul>Fear: to be powerless</ul>
          <ul>Weakness: taking their rebellion too far and becoming obsessed by it</ul>
          <ul>Talent: having big, outrageous ideas and inspiring others to join them</ul>
          </p>
        </div>)
