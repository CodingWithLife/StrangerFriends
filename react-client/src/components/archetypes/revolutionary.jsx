          <h1>The OUTLAW seeks revolution

            The outlaw isn’t afraid.
            Where the innocent touches the part of you that loved snack time in kindergarten,
            the outlaw archetype appeals to the part of you that cut classes in high school.

            Building a cult following like Apple is the ultimate goal of an outlaw brand.
            Remember those old iPod commercials where monochromatic figures had the times of their lives dancing?
            That ad doesn’t tell you to stand in a crowd or passively attend a concert. It tells you to be yourself,
            to dance whenever you like, and to do it with Apple. If you think Apple doesn’t have a cult following,
            consider this: Did people wait in line for hours when the Galaxy S7 was released?e</h1>
        </div>)
