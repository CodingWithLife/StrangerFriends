          <p>
          When the revolutionary sees something in the world that isn’t working, they look to change it.
          Rebels like to do things differently.
          However, sometimes rebels can abandon perfectly good traditions just because they have a desire for reform.
          Rebels can be charismatic and easily encourage others to follow them in their pursuit of rebellion.
