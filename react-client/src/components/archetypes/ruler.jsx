          <h3>The Ruler</h3>
          <p>The ruler loves to be in control.
          They often have a clear vision of what will work in a given situation.
          They believe they know what is best for a group or community and can get frustrated if others donâ€™t share their vision.
          However, they usually have the interests of others at heart even if occasionally their actions are misguided.

          <ul>Goal: create a prosperous, successful family or community</ul>
          <ul>Fear: chaos, being undermined or overthrown</ul>
          <ul>Weakness: being authoritarian, unable to delegate</ul>
          <ul>Talent: responsibility, leadership.</ul>
          </p>
        </div>)
