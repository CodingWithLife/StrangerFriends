            Luxury and exclusivity â€“ A ruler brand is a gatekeeper.
            Perception as high-quality and expensive is critical,
            so product categories that fall under this umbrella include jewelry and high-end vehicles.

            Do you buy a Mercedes-Benz because of its crash-test rating?
            No. That quietly understood value is what a ruler brand sells.</h1>
