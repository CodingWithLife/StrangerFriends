          <p>
          The ruler loves to be in control.
          They often have a clear vision of what will work in a given situation.
          They believe they know what is best for a group or community and can get frustrated if others donâ€™t share their vision.
          However, they usually have the interests of others at heart even if occasionally their actions are misguided.
