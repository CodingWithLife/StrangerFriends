            Passion, pleasure, and sensuality are keys to the lover’s heart.
            A lover brand wants you to associate them with the intimate moments in your life.
            What do you buy to celebrate? How do you indulge your significant other? Chances are,
            you’re buying from a lover brand.
            Think of Godiva Chocolate ads. Do they ever make you think about your health,
            your finances or your future? No. Godiva seduces you. It shows off its richness and creaminess.</h1>
