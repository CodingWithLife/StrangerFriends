            The explorer is never happy unless experiencing new things. They may enjoy visiting different countries or they may be happy learning about new ideas and philosophies.

            Goal: to experience as much of life as possible in one lifetime
            Fear: getting trapped or being forced to conform
            Weakness: aimless wandering and inability to stick at things
            Talent: being true to their own desires and a sense of wonder
