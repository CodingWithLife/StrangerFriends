        <h1>The CREATOR craves perfection
            A creator isn’t worried about the cost of production or making things at scale.
            While the magician stresses vision and imagination,
            creators are different – they strive to create a product you can’t live without.
            Lego is a great example of a creator archetype.
            In one of ad, Lego recreated in stunning detail the most famous sights of the world.
            They didn’t create some new technology.
            Lego used the simplest technology possible: blocks.
            They took this simplicity and pushed it to its most perfect extreme.</h1>
