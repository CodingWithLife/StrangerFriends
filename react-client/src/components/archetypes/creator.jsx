        <h1>The Creator
          The creator is born to bring something into being that does not yet exist. They hate to be passive consumers of anything, much preferring to make their own entertainment. Creators are often artists or musicians though they can be found in almost any area of work.

          Goal: to create things of enduring value
          Fear: failing to create anything great
          Weakness: perfectionism and creative blocks caused by fear of not being exceptional
          Talent: creativity and imagination</h1>
        </div>)

export default Creator;
