            Magician brands donâ€™t build you a better toothbrush or help you keep your house clean;
            they bring your wildest dreams to life. Disney is an example of a magical brand.
            Though it is fundamentally a media company, the company offers a transformative experience.
            The organization sits in a category of its own because of its vision.
            Imagine another brand that could build the Magic Kingdom or a Disney World.</h1>
        </div>)
