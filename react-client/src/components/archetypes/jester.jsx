          Humor, silliness, and nonsense are all in a jester’s toolkit.
          The goal of a jester brand is to make you smile with light-hearted fun.
          The Old Spice Man is an all-time favorite ad campaign and the perfect example of a jester archetype.
          Some male consumers react well to hyper-masculine branding, while others don’t.
          By making a joke out of these super manly brands, Old Spice appeal to both sides.</h1>
